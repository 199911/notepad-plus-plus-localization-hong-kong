# Notepad++ for Hongkonger

This repo is created for **Hong Kong Cantonese** localization for Notepad++.

All translations are done by human base on:

- **All about Hong Kong**: Not Macau Cantonese, not Guangzhou Cantonese, but Hong Kong Cantonese! This localization contains some words only used by Hongkongers.
- **How we communicate in daily life**: Hong Kong culture is unique mixture of Chinese, British and Western culture in general. We speak Cantonese with some English together. Especially for some technology terms, I would like to retain some English words.
- **A little bit Taiwan**: We'd got lots of benefit from Taiwan software and books - Eten (倚天中文系統), PC Home, BBS, and more. Remember the old days? I would adapt some terms from Taiwanese Mandarin, if they are not available in Hong Kong.

:heart: Notepad++. :heart: Hong Kong. :heart: Hongkonger.

The translation is done based on Notepad++ v7.8.9 Stand With Hong Kong Edition. Welcome issues and pull requests.


# 本地化嘅宗旨

Notepad\+\+ 轉介面語言嘅講法係叫 localization 而唔係 translation，所謂本地化，唔係一味轉晒啲字做中文就算，而係要真實咁反映我哋嘅文化，要貼近日常生活。所以，我係以呢啲方針嚟寫嘅：

- 我哋香港人平日點講嘢，裏面就點寫番出嚟，如果唔係，用番台灣中文版就得，駛乜搞咁多嘢。
- 盡量用番英文版嘅精神同𠹺用字，例如 file vs document，跟嚟佢寫檔案同𠹺文件。
- 有啲 case 係日常已經寫異體字，就寫異體字而非正字。
- 有啲 case 係日常已經講英文，就寫英文，但最少要正確，例如「嘥屎」，譯做「大細」唔夠準確，不如寫番 size。
- 香港一早已經接受台灣電腦雜誌丶技術書嘅熏陶，軟件嘅介面主要係英文同正體中文，有啲 case 我哋日常唔會點講，咪跟番台灣囉，例如 regular expression 跟番寫「規則運算式」。
- 唯一一樣嘢除外：唔講粗口（我忍咗好耐），呢樣同中學生唔應該食煙同睇咸片嘅道理一樣，sor9y。

每一句我都重複想像，嗰句嘢**兜口兜面點樣講出嚟**，譯嘅嘢要配合生活情景，文化傳承要貼地丶本土，唔求優雅唔怕庸俗。


# Need Your Help

I want to catch up for Hacktoberfest 2020. There are many things you can fix. For example:

- Typo, grammer, wrong words.
- Inconsistant phrase and words across menu, descriptions, etc.
- Unable to display the whole item (sentense) on screen/window.


# Contribution Guild (Short version)

- Keep PR small. e.g. 1 PR for 1 character error across the whole file, 1 PR for 1 inconsistant phrase.
- Only accept words and phrases that Hongkongers would speak in daily life.
- Only accept PR that the contents will benefit the localization.
- No spam.
