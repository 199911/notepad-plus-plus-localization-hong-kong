# Notepad++ for Hongkonger

This repo is created for **Hong Kong Cantonese** localization for Notepad++.

All translations are done by human base on:

- **All about Hong Kong**: Not Macau Cantonese, not Guangzhou Cantonese, but Hong Kong Cantonese! This localization contains some words only used by Hongkongers.
- **How we communicate in daily life**: Hong Kong culture is unique mixture of Chinese, British and Western culture in general. We speak Cantonese with some English together. Especially for some technology terms, I would like to retain some English words.
- **A little bit Taiwan**: We'd got lots of benefit from Taiwan software and books - Eten (倚天中文系統), PC Home, BBS, and more. Remember the old days? I would adapt some terms from Taiwanese Mandarin, if they are not available in Hong Kong.

:heart: Notepad++. :heart: Hong Kong. :heart: Hongkonger.

The translation is done based on Notepad++ v7.8.9 Stand With Hong Kong Edition. Welcome issues and pull requests.


# Need Your Help

I want to catch up for Hacktoberfest 2020. There are many things you can fix. For example:

- Typo, grammer, wrong words.
- Inconsistant phrase and words across menu, descriptions, etc.
- Unable to display the whole item (sentense) on screen/window.


# Contribution Guild (Short version)

- Keep PR small. e.g. 1 PR for 1 character error across the whole file, 1 PR for 1 inconsistant phrase.
- Only accept words and phrases that Hongkongers would speak in daily life.
- Only accept PR that the contents will benefit the localization.
- No spam.


# Todo

- [ ] Philisophy session (in Cantonese)
- [ ] Better tools experience
- [ ] Other files for Github community
